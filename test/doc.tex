\maketitle

This is a document where I want to cite some references using BibTeX [1].
For example, \cite{knuthwebsite} discusses programming.
Also, \cite{latexcompanion} is a great resource for learning LaTeX.
Another citation is for Einstein's famous equation, \cite{einstein}.
\textbf{Note:} To make the citations appear, you will need to compile the document with LaTeX and then run BibTeX.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item First, compile your LaTeX file using "pdflatex your\_file.tex". This generates a .aux file.
    \item Then, run BibTeX using "bibtex your\_file". This uses the .aux file and creates a .bbl file.
    \item Finally, compile your LaTeX file again with "pdflatex your\_file.tex" and once more with "pdflatex your\_file.tex". This will include the .bbl file with the bibliography and correctly render the citations.
\end{enumerate}

\bibliographystyle{plain} % Or another style like abbrv, ieeetr, etc.
\bibliography{doc} % The name of your .bib file (without the .bib extension)

\end{document}
